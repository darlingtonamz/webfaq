# Synopsis

WebFAQ is an interactive FAQ plugin for the web. 

Here we put short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

# Code Example

This project is built on Rails(Ruby on Rails), and relational data is stored using PostGreSQL, styling is done using SASS, and the interactivity of the project is based on JQuery.

# Motivation

The traditional FAQs in website are static and the website admin is god. We descided to change this, by creating an FAQ system that will allow the user/reader to give feedback and show satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Thus making FAQs fun and interactive.

# Installation

Visit our site and create an FAQ with many questions and answers, when you are done, you can use our systwm to generate an embed code for your website.
